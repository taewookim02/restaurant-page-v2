This project demonstrates the use of Webpack for module bundling, incorporating module splitting, loading CSS and images via Webpack, and dynamically generating the DOM using JavaScript. The main goal is to showcase a single-page application architecture for a restaurant page, where content is loaded dynamically based on user interaction.

## Features

- **Webpack for Bundling**: Utilizes Webpack for bundling scripts, styles, and assets.
- **Module Splitting**: Organizes code into modules for better maintainability and scalability.
- **Dynamic DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically generates content on the webpage using pure JavaScript.
- **CSS and Image Loading**: Loads CSS styles and images directly through Webpack, demonstrating the handling of various asset types.
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Implements SPA behavior for seamless user experience.
